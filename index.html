Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 "><p>Dog meat is the flesh and other edible parts derived from dogs. Historically, human consumption of dog meat has been recorded in many parts of the world.
